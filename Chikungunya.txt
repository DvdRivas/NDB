synonyms:
Arbovirus A Chikungunya TypeCHIKCK

overview:
Chikungunya is a rare viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. It is characterized by a rash, fever, and severe joint pain (arthralgias) that usually lasts for three to seven days. Because of its effect on the joints, Chikungunya has been classified among the Arthritic Viruses. It primarily occurs in tropical areas of the world.

symptoms:
The early symptoms of Chikungunya include fever, headache, and joint pain (arthralgias) that may be so severe that they may be disabling.  The knees, elbows, wrists, ankles, and/or fingers are generally effected.  Joint pain increases with movement and is worse in the morning.  However, it may take several weeks before the symptoms improve.  Chikungunya is not associated with permanent joint damage.
Other symptoms may include abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia), sore throat, lack of appetite (anorexia), and vomiting.  Backache and rash on the face and neck are also common in people with Chikungunya.  Occasionally the membranes that line the eyes may become inflamed (conjunctivitis) and lymph glands may become swollen (lymphadenopathy).  The fever usually subsides before the 10th day.
