Ciguatera Fish Poisoning

synonyms:
Ciguatera PoisoningIchthyosarcotoxism

overview:
Ciguatera fish poisoning is a rare disorder that occurs because of the ingestion of certain contaminated tropical and subtropical fish. When ingested, the toxin (ciguatoxin), which is present at high levels in these contaminated fish, may affect the digestive, muscular, and/or neurological systems. More than 400 different species of fish have been implicated as a cause of ciguatera fish poisoning, including many that are otherwise considered edible (i.e., sea bass, snapper, and perch). These fish typically inhabit low-lying shore areas or coral reefs in tropical or subtropical areas. In the United States, ciguatera fish poisoning has occurred more frequently in the last decade perhaps as a result of a general increase in fish consumption.

symptoms:
The symptoms of acute ciguatera fish poisoning may begin as soon as 30 minutes after eating contaminated fish.  The initial symptoms may include itching, tingling, and numbness of the lips, tongue, hands, and/or feet. Other symptoms during the first six to 17 hours are abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or a red skin rash (pruritus).  Chills, hot and cold temperature reversal, generalized weakness, restlessness, dizziness, wheezing, blurred vision, abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia), muscle aches (myalgias), and/or joint pain (arthralgias) may also develop.
The acute symptoms of ciguatera fish poisoning generally disappear within a few days.  However, neurological symptoms may continue for several months.  Some affected individuals experience abnormally low blood pressure upon standing from a seated position (orthostatic hypotension).  In severe cases, there may be rapid progression to breathing difficulties (dyspnea) and muscular paralysis.  Life-threatening complications (i.e., abnormally slow heartbeat, respiratory arrest, convulsions, or coma) may occur in these severe cases within 24 hours.
