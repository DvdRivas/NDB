symptoms:
Depersonalization disorder is characterized by persistent or recurring episodes of the loss of the sense of self (depersonalization). The symptoms of depersonalization disorder are sufficient enough to cause marked distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of life. The usual sense of one’s self or reality is temporarily changed or lost. A feeling of detachment from, or being an outside observer of, one’s mental processes or body occurs. The affected individual may feel as if he/she is in a dream. Affected individuals may experience various types of lack of sensory stimulation (sensory anesthesia) and a sensation of not being in complete control of one’s actions, including speech. This condition may not occur during the course of another mental disorder or be the effects of a substance or general medical condition.
Depersonalization disorder usually starts during adolescence or early adulthood. The disorder is usually chronic with periods of remission. More severe manifestations may be aggravated by mild anxiety or depression. The disorder usually disappears gradually.
