overview:
Dentin dysplasia type I is an inherited disorder characterized by atypical development of the “dentin” of a person’s teeth. Dentin makes up most of the tooth and is the bone-like material under the enamel. It serves to contain the pulp of the tooth. The pulp is a soft tissue that is well supplied with blood vessels and nerves. This disorder is also known as radicular dentin dysplasia because the underdeveloped, abnormal pulp tissue is predominately in the roots of the teeth. The teeth lack pulp chambers or have half-moon shaped pulp chambers in short or abnormally shaped roots. The condition may affect juvenile as well as adult teeth and, since the roots are abnormally short, usually leads to the premature loss of teeth.  The color of the teeth is usually normal.

symptoms:
Some people with dentin dysplasia type I have teeth with a bluish-brown shine.  In most instances, however, the teeth have normally colored enamel.  It is clear from X-ray photos that the tooth pulp chambers in the roots are unusually small, half-moon shaped or lacking altogether.  The roots are very short and may appear to be dark (radiolucent) on X-rays.
Both the baby teeth and the permanent teeth are affected.  The teeth are often poorly aligned and can be chipped easily.  Without treatment, persons with dentin dysplasia type I may lose their teeth by age 30-40.
