overview:
Colorado Tick Fever is a rare viral disease transmitted by ticks that commonly inhabit the western United States. Major symptoms may include fever, headaches, muscle aches, and/or generalized discomfort (myalgia). The symptoms usually last for about a week and resolve on their own.

symptoms:
Colorado Tick Fever typically has a sudden onset about five days after a tick bite.  It usually occurs at moderate altitudes during spring or early summer. The symptoms are flu-like and may include chills, headache, increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and a lack of appetite.  Muscle pain occurs, especially in the legs and back.  There may be a slight, reddish rash, and the spleen can become enlarged (splenomegaly). Fever may rise sharply for two or three days and then subside only to return after a day or two (biphasic fever).  The second fever typically subsides after 2 to 4 days.
In very rare childhood cases, severe illness involving the central nervous system may occur.  Symptoms may include acute inflammation of the membranes around the brain (aseptic meningitis) and/or spinal cord (encephalitis).
