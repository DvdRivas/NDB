Denys-Drash Syndrome

synonyms:
DDSDrash syndromenephropathy and disorders of sexual developmentWilms tumor, pseudo or true hermaphroditism

overview:
Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) is characterized by abnormal kidney function (congenital nephropathy), a cancerous tumor of the kidney called Wilms tumor, and disorders of sexual development in affected males. Most affected females have normal genitalia. DDS is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the Wilms tumor suppressor gene,WT1.

symptoms:
The initial symptoms of DDS may be similar to nephrotic syndrome and include edema, abdominal distention and recurrent infections, sometimes present at birth but more often developing between 1 and 2 years of age. Many affected children develop high blood pressure (hypertension). The kidney abnormality that results in abnormal kidney function is termed diffuse mesangial sclerosis and usually results in a progression to renal failure during the first three years of life.
Wilms tumor occurs in approximately 90% of affected individuals and is sometimes the first clinical sign of the disease. Signs of Wilms tumor can include abdominal swelling, blood in the urine, decreased urination, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, paleness, weight loss and lethargy.
Disorders of sexual development also occur in males with DDS and are rare in females with this condition. These are conditions in which a boy has normal male chromosomes (46, XY), but the external genitals are incompletely formed, ambiguous, or clearly female. Testes may be normal, malformed, absent, or internal (undescended). Affected individuals of both genders are at risk for cancers of the testes or ovaries.
