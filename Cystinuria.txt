Cystinuria

synonyms:
CSNUcystinuria-lysinuria

overview:
Cystinuria is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by excessive amounts of undissolved cystine in the urine, as well as three chemically similar amino acids: arginine, lysine, and ornithine. Excess cystine in the urine can lead to the formation of crystals and stones (calculi) in the kidney, bladder, and/or urinary tract (ureters). Some people with cystinuria do not form stones, while others frequently form stones.

symptoms:
People with cystinuria excrete abnormally high levels of cystine in the urine. The level of cystine is so high that it remains undissolved in the urine. The amino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine are also excreted in massive amounts by people with this disorder, but they dissolve more readily in the urine and are not associated with any particular symptoms.
The initial symptom of cystinuria is usually sharp pain in the lower back or side of the abdomen (renal colic). Other symptoms may include blood in the urine (hematuria), obstruction of the urinary tract, and/or infections of the urinary tract. Frequent recurrences ultimately may lead to kidney damage.
People with cystinuria typically produce jagged stones that are small, though some form very large stones. Stones may be accompanied by urinary “gravel,” which consists of yellowish-brown hexagonal crystals. All patients with urinary stones should be screened for cystinuria.
