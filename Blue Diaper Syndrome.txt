Blue Diaper Syndrome

overview:
Blue diaper syndrome is a rare, genetic metabolic disorder characterized by the incomplete intestinal breakdown of tryptophan, a dietary nutrient. Symptoms typically include digestive disturbances, fever, irritability and visual difficulties. Some children with blue diaper syndrome may also develop kidney disease. Infants with this disorder may have bluish urine-stained diapers. Blue diaper syndrome is inherited as an autosomal or X-linked recessive trait.

symptoms:
Blue diaper syndrome is a rare inborn error metabolism that is usually detected when urine produces unusual blue stains on an infantâ€™s diapers (indoluria). This occurs when intestinal bacteria break down excessive amounts of unabsorbed tryptophan.
Symptoms of blue diaper syndrome may include irritability, constipation, poor appetite, vomiting, and the failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Some children with Blue diaper syndrome may have frequent fevers and intestinal infections.
Additional symptoms may include poor vision and abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia).  Excessive calcium may accumulate in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) leading to impaired kidney function and possible kidney failure.
Some infants may have eye abnormalities including underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the optic disc, abnormal eye movements, and an abnormally small cornea (microcornea), the front, clear portion of the eye through which light passes.
