overview:
Summary
Cri du chat syndrome (CdCS or 5p-) is a rare genetic disorder caused by a loss (deletion) in chromosome 5. Symptoms can be different from person to person depending on the exact size and location of the deleted genetic material. Common symptoms include a unique cry that sounds like the mewing of a cat, characteristic facial features, slow growth and a head that is smaller than expected (microcephaly). Affected children also show moderate to severe intellectual disability, as well as delays in gaining skills (developmental delays) and additional symptoms. In most patients, CdCS is caused by a random (de novo) genetic error that occurs very early when the baby is developing inside the womb. Treatment is based on improving the symptoms and may include early interventional services, therapies and surgeries.
Introduction
CdCS was first described in medical literature in 1963 by Dr. Lejeune who named the disorder after the distinctive cat-like cry. In French, cri du chat translates into “cry of the cat”.

symptoms:
The most recognizable sign is a characteristic high-pitched, shrill cry that is present during the first few weeks of life. The cry, which sounds like the mewing of a cat, becomes less noticeable as affected infants grow older.
Signs and symptoms can be different depending on the size and location of the chromosome 5 deletion. The following signs and symptoms have been described in people affected with cri du chat syndrome:
Low birth weightGrowth deficienciesLow muscle tone (hypotonia)Head that is smaller than expected for the child’s age (microcephaly)Distinctive facial features that may include:
Plump or remarkably round (moon) faceWide space in the nose area between eyes (broad nasal bridge)Widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism)Crossed eyes (strabismus)Downward slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures)Downturned corners of the mouthLow set earsA smaller sized jaw than would be expected for age and sex (micrognathia)Short space between the upper lip to the nose (philtrum)Opening or split in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate)Opening or split of the upper lip (cleft lip)Full lower lip
Middle cleft in the fleshy, hanging ball (uvula) located in the back of throat (bifid uvula)Curved spine (scoliosis)Recurrent ear infections that may result in a higher risk of hearing lossHeart defects that are present at birth (congenital heart defect) in about 15-20% of affected childrenInguinal hernia (development of a tear in the supportive tissue of the lower abdomen allowing a portion of the intestines to protrude out)Gastroesophageal reflex (passage or flowing back (reflux) of the contents of the stomach or small intestines into the esophagus)Abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tractRespiratory difficultiesWebbing of the fingers and toes (syndactyly)Bending or curving of the pinkies inward toward the fourth finger (clinodactyly)ClubfeetStructural anomalies of the voice box (larynx)Nearsightedness (myopia) and cataracts may developPrematurely graying hairRepeated respiratory and intestinal infectionsGenital abnormalities including:Failure of the testes to descend into the scrotum (cryptorchidism)Opening on the underside of the penis instead of the tip (hypospadias)Hirschsprung’s disease, a condition involving missing nerve cells in the muscles of part or all of the large intestine (colon) which causes difficulty passing stool
As affected children get older, the following signs and symptoms may change:
The round face changes to a more narrow, long faceThe low muscle tone (hypotonia) changes to high muscle tone (hypertonia)
In addition, the children may develop some developmental and behavioral problems such as:
Motor skill developmental delays including delays in head control, sitting up and walkingModerate to severe intellectual disabilityDelay in speech developmentAffected children can understand speech better than they can communicate itHyperactivitySelf-injurious behaviorRepetitive movementsGentle personalityObsessive attachment to objectsFeeding difficulties
