CHARGE Syndrome

synonyms:
CHARGE associationHall-Hittner syndromecoloboma, heart, atresia of the choanae, retardation of growth and development, genital and urinary anomalies, and ear anomalies

overview:
CHARGE syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a specific combination of signs and symptoms described by its acronym CHARGE:
Coloboma of the eyeHeart defectsAtresia of the choanaeRetardation of growth and developmentGenital abnormalitiesEar anomalies, including deafness
We have learned more about the possible signs and symptoms that can occur with this syndrome after the discovery that variants and deletions in theCHD7gene cause CHARGE syndrome. Some researchers may refer to CHARGE syndrome as a “CHD7-related disorder.”
There is significant variability among affected individuals, even among those in the same family and among different families with the same disease-causing variant inCHD7gene.

symptoms:
There are features in CHARGE syndrome, referred to as major characteristics, that are rarely seen in other conditions. These features include coloboma, cranial nerve anomalies, choanal atresia and typical CHARGE ear anomalies.
Major Characteristics:
Coloboma (present in 70%-90% of patients) — an eye condition where a gap occurs due to missing tissue that forms the eye. It can affect the iris (colored part of the eye), retina (light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) or the eye nerve (optic nerve) leading to:Light sensitivityRefractive errors, a vision problem where the eye shape prevents light from focusing correctly on the retina:Myopia (nearsightedness)Hyperopia (farsightedness)Astigmatism (blurred or distorted vision for near and distant objects)Presbyopia (difficulty seeing close objects, common in middle-aged and older adults)Loss of upper/central visual field (central and upper parts of vision appear as dark spots or blurry areas)BlindnessIncreased risk of retinal detachment leading to blindnessCranial nerve anomalies– the 12 pairs of cranial nerves that transmit information between the brain and sensory organs (eyes, ears, nose and tongue)Cranial nerve VIII anomaly (95% of patients) results in sensorineural deafnessCranial nerve I anomaly (90% of patients) leads to a reduced or absent sense of smell, which can worsen feeding difficultiesCranial nerve VII anomaly results in facial asymmetry and lack of facial expressionCranial nerve IX/X anomaly (60%-80% of patients) causes problems with swallowing and leads to abnormal gastrointestinal motility which may result in:Nausea and aspiration of food into the lungs, risking pneumoniaMany children require feeding through a gastrostomy tube until they can swallow safelyEar malformations that may result in mild to profound deafness, which can be sensorineural, conductive or mixed, and lead to balance issuesAbnormal ear shape (90% of patients): ears may protrude, lack lobes and have poorly developed helix (outer ear edge) that are known as typical CHARGE earMiddle ear anomalies causing conductive hearing loss.Inner ear anomalies affecting sound processing.Mondini defect (90% of patients)– a cochlear anomaly affecting hearing.Semicircular canal defect (94% of patients) affecting balance and motor developmentAtresia of choanaeThe choanae are passages from the back of the nose to the throat and that when obstructed may cause difficulties when breathing through the nose.
Minor Characteristics:
Heart defects (75%-80% of patients) from harmless murmurs to severe defects, especially tetralogy of FallotSmall eyes (microphthalmia) or absence of eyes (anophthalmia)– severe forms of coloboma.Slow growth starts in older childrenDelayed motor skills development like sitting unsupported and walkingCleft lip (with or without cleft palate)Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism affecting hormone production, leading to:Small penis (micropenis)Undescended testes (cryptorchidism)Incomplete or delayed puberty in males and femalesTracheoesophageal fistula: abnormal connection between the esophagus and tracheaDistinctive facial features: square face, facial asymmetryCognitive issues: normal intelligence to significant learning disabilities, lack of speech, poor communicationEsophageal atresia: upper esophagus not connecting to the lower esophagus and stomachDecreased muscle tone (hypotonia) in the upper body affecting motor skills
Less Common Features:
Kidney anomaliesImmune system issues (possibly related to DiGeorge syndrome)Spinal curvature (scoliosis or kyphosis)Limb anomalies: extra fingers/toes (polydactyly), missing fingers/toes (oligodactyly), clubfoot, long bone anomalies.Typical CHARGE hand: square with short fingers, thumb shaped like a finger, hockey stick-shaped palmar creaseBrain anomalies: small head (microcephaly), enlarged brain ventriclesDevelopmental delays: sensory deficits and health complications often improve over timeBehavioral challenges: autism-like behaviors, obsessive-compulsive tendencies due to communication problems
