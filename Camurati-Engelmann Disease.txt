overview:
Summary
Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is characterized by increased bone density primarily affecting the long bones of the arms and legs and the skull. The thickening of these bones leads to pain, a waddling gait, muscle weakness, and extreme fatigue. Increased density of the skull can cause a variety of neurological deficits such as headaches, hearing loss, vision problems, dizziness (vertigo), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and even facial paralysis. The first symptoms of the condition can appear at varying ages, but usually during childhood, with pain and proximal muscle weakness developing by adolescence. CED is often diagnosed based on a physical exam and radiographic findings (X-rays). CED is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is caused by changes (mutations) in theTGFB1gene.

symptoms:
The first signs and symptoms of CED are usually limb pain, a waddling gait, muscle weakness, and extreme tiredness. If the bones at the base of the skull are affected, the individual may experience headaches, hearing loss, vision problems, vertigo, tinnitus, and even facial paralysis. Additional musculoskeletal features include scoliosis, joint contractures, knock knees, and flat feet. The individual may also present with abnormally long limbs in proportion to the height of their body, a decrease in muscle mass and body fat, visible prominence of the long bones in the legs, and rarely delayed puberty. While the first signs and symptoms can appear at varying ages, most appear during childhood or adolescence.
The signs and symptoms of CED can be extremely variable even among affected family members.  Some individuals with aTGFB1mutation do not develop signs or symptoms of the disease or evidence of increased bone density on X-ray examination (i.e., reduced penetrance).
