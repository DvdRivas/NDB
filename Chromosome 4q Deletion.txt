overview:
Summary
Chromosome 4q deletion is a chromosomal disorder caused by a missing piece of the long arm of chromosome 4. It was first described in 1967 and is linked to symptoms in several organ systems. The patient may have an extremely prominent forehead (frontal bossing), enlargement of the back part of the head, low placement of ears, short broad hands and feet, unusually small size associated with slow or delayed growth, congenital heart defects, and possible intellectual disability.

symptoms:
Patients with chromosome 4q deletion may have the following symptoms: unusual skull shape, short nose with unusual bridge, low-set ears that may not have formed well, cleft in the roof of the mouth, short breastbone, poor or delayed growth, moderate to severe intellectual disability, heart defects, unusual heart rhythm (arrhythmia), defective urinary and reproductive organs (genitourinary defects), small size, small hands and feet, unusually wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), a pointed fifth finger and nail which is common for this disorder, and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia). Some children may have a small jaw (micrognathia) which results in difficulties with breathing. There may be unusual brain findings (corpus callosum). In some patients, slow growth and intellectual disability may be present without obvious physical abnormalities, making it difficult to recognize this disorder.
Some children with chromosome 4q deletion have psychiatric symptoms. These include aggression, hearing speech that is not present (verbal hallucinations), mood swings, and delusions. Not all people with chromosome 4q deletion have these symptoms, and symptoms can vary greatly.
