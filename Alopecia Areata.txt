overview:
Alopecia areata is a disorder characterized by loss of hair. Sometimes, this means simply a few bare patches on the scalp. In other cases, hair loss is more extensive. Although the exact cause is not known, this is thought to be an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system, the bodyâ€™s own defense system, mistakenly attacks the hair follicles, the tiny structures from which hairs grow. Unpredictable hair loss is the only noticeable symptom of this disorder. Regrowth of hair may or may not occur.  Hair loss is usually confined to the head and face, although the entire body may be involved.

symptoms:
Alopecia areata often begins suddenly with oval or round bald patches appearing most commonly on the scalp.  Other areas of hairy skin may also be involved.  Gradually, the affected skin becomes  smooth.  New patches may spread by joining existing bald patches.  These larger bald areas can appear while hair is regrowing in older hairless patches.  Loss of hair can be permanent in some cases.  Hair follicles may deteriorate, but oil producing glands in the skin (sebaceous glands) usually change very little. The skin does not become hard or atrophied.  In a very few cases, all body hair may be lost.  Cases beginning during childhood tend to be more severe than cases with an onset during adulthood.
The physical manifestations of this disorder may not be as difficult to handle for some individuals as the emotional ones.  Most people with alopecia areata are generally healthy otherwise, and the disorder itself is not a sign of a serious or life-threatening disease.
