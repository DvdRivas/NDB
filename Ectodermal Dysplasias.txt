Ectodermal Dysplasias

synonyms:
ED

overview:
The ectodermal dysplasias (EDs) are a heterogeneous group of nearly 100 inherited disorders characterized by anomalies in at least two of the structures derived from the embryonic ectoderm, with at least one involving the skin appendages (hair, nails, sweat glands) or teeth. Other tissues derived from the primitive ectoderm that can be involved in EDs include the mammary glands, adrenal medulla, central nervous system, inner ear, retina, optic lens, pigment cells and branchial arch cartilages. Advances in molecular genetics and developmental biology have led to the identification of the causative genes and developmental pathways in at least 80 of the EDs.

symptoms:
Each of the nearly 100 EDs has its own set of clinical signs and symptoms. Commonly, the conditions will have one or more of the following associated findings:
Teeth: reduced number, abnormal shape or sizeHair: abnormal structure, sparse, slow-growing, often light-coloredSweat glands: often reduced number and abnormal structure, leading to decreased sweat production and risk of elevated body temperature (hyperthermia)Nails: toenails and fingernails can be absent, thin, thick, groovedCleft lip and/or palate, particularly in theTP63-related disordersLimbs: split hand/foot, oligodactyly, syndactyly, digital duplicationSkin: spotty hypoplasia with fat herniation, severe skin erosions, pigmentary abnormalities, etcEyes: dry eye, corneal erosions/opacification, eyelid fusion, micropthalmiaGenitourinary system:Â  hydroureter, hydronephrosis, renal agenesis, micropenis, cryptorchidism, hypospadiasGrowth failure (height and/or weight)
