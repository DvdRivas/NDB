overview:
Summary
ADNP syndrome, also called Helsmoortel-Van Der Aa syndrome, is a genetic disorder that affects brain development and can lead to a wide range of challenges.
The symptoms can vary greatly from one child to another, but almost all affected children have developmental and intellectual delays, difficulties with motor function, delayed or absent speech and features of autism.
The disorder can potentially affect multiple systems of the body including the brain, heart, immune system, gastrointestinal system, endocrine system and musculoskeletal system.
Feeding and gastrointestinal issues are common, and many infants have low muscle tone (hypotonia) that can make them appear floppy. These children might also have sensory processing disorders, sleep problems and a high tolerance for pain, making it hard for parents to know when they are hurt.
Most of the affected children have distinctive facial features, and many develop early primary tooth eruption and often have a happy disposition and unprovoked episodes of laughter and smiling.
About half of the children develop breathing irregularities (breath holding episodes) and episodes of developmental regression of speech that are usually regained over time with intensive therapy.
ADNP syndrome is caused by changes (variants) in theADNPgene, which typically happen spontaneously, meaning they are not inherited from parents. This syndrome is one of the more common single-gene causes of autism.

symptoms:
ADNP syndrome is complex and not fully understood, even though certain key symptoms are commonly associated with it.
The disorder is rare, with a small number of diagnosed cases, making it difficult to fully grasp all symptoms and the progression of the condition. The most common characteristics found in those with ADNP syndrome are developmental delays (in all patients), intellectual delays (in all patients), motor planning delays (96%) of varying degrees, delayed or absent speech (98%) and autism spectrum disorder including autistic features (93%).
Each child’s experience with ADNP syndrome can vary, and not all children will have every symptom described below. Signs and symptoms may include:
Neurological and developmental symptoms:
Low muscle tone (hypotonia): Seen in 78% of infants, making them appear “floppy”Brain abnormalities: Present in 56% of children, including wide ventricles (29%), cerebral atrophy (18%), delayed myelination (9%) and white matter lesions (8%)Seizures: About 16% may develop seizures, with some infants showing absent-like seizures and breath-holding episodes.Developmental regression: Approximately 50% of children may experience temporary loss of skills, particularly in speech.Missed milestones: Delays in sitting, holding up the head and walking are common.Motor planning delays: Most children have mild to severe difficulties in coordinating movements.Speech delays: Children may have trouble speaking; some may remain non-verbal due to oral motor disorders affecting the tongue.
Behavioral and psychological symptoms:
Happy disposition: Children often appear happy and easily amused, having unprovoked episodes of laughter and smiling which can delay the diagnosis of behavioral disorders like autism.Autism spectrum traits: Many children show poor social interaction and repetitive behaviors, meeting criteria for autism spectrum disorder.Unusual social interactions: Unlike typical autism, children with ADNP syndrome may seek out and enjoy interactions with adults.Sensory sensitivities: About 67% of children have strong preferences or aversions to sensory experiences.Oral sensory seeking: Common behaviors include licking, chewing non-food items and putting objects in their mouth.Other behavioral issues: Other behavioral problems include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), temper tantrums, aggression, mood disorders and anxiety.
Feeding and gastrointestinal symptoms:
Oral motor issues: 83% of infants may have difficulties with sucking, chewing, and swallowing.Risk of aspiration: Food or liquids may enter the lungs, increasing the risk of complications.Nutritional support: Some children may need thickened liquids or a feeding tube.Digestive problems: Many children experience acid reflux, constipation, diarrhea, cyclic vomiting, delayed digestion and irritable bowel conditions.Feeding tubes: Severe feeding difficulties may necessitate the use of a feeding tube.Hyperphagia: Some children, as they grow, develop an increased appetite and may struggle with feeling full, leading to excessive weight gain.
Heart problems:
Congenital heart defects: Present in 38% of children, including ventricle or atrial septal defects, right aortic arch, tachycardia, mitral valve prolapse, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary artery stenosis and tetralogy of Fallot
Facial, vision and dental features:
Distinctive facial features: These include a prominent forehead, high hairline, droopy eyelids (ptosis), a thin upper lip, a broad nasal bridge, malformed ears, widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) and crossed eyes (strabismus).Vision problems: Farsightedness (hypermetropia), crossed eyes (strabismus), nearsightedness (myopia), abnormal eye movements (nystagmus), dropped eyelid (ptosis) and cortical vision impairment have been reported.Early tooth eruption: Some children have a full set of baby teeth by their first birthday, which may be small, jagged and discolored, potentially leading to early tooth decay.
Musculoskeletal symptoms:
Joint and bone abnormalities: These may include underdeveloped fingernails and toenails, extra fingers or toes (polydactyly), small pinkies fixed in a bent position (clinodactyly), hip problems, chest deformities, skull deformities and prominent finger joints.Hand and feet anomalies: Finger abnormalities, single palmar crease, nail anomalies and a wide space between the first toe and second toe (sandal gap)
High pain threshold:
About 64% of children may not show signs of pain, even with injuries like fractures, making it difficult to detect pain or discomfort.
Hearing loss that may be due to:
Narrow auditory canal, frequent ear infections (otitis media)
Additional symptoms may include:
Abnormally loose (lax) joints that have a larger range of motion than normal (hyperlaxity)Abnormal sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis)Recurrent infections, especially upper respiratory and urinary tract that may indicate an underlying problem with the immune systemGrowth delays that may result in children who are shorter than expected for their age and gender (short stature)Truncal obesity, in which the trunk of the body is affected as opposed to the arms and legsDifficulty regulating body temperature, and many have cold feet and hands, and some parents report that children spike fevers extremely fastEarly puberty, thyroid hormone problems, growth hormone deficiencyUrinary tract anomalies such as narrow ureters (tubes that connect the kidney with the bladder) and bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (urine flows backward from the bladder to one or both ureters and sometimes to the kidneys)
