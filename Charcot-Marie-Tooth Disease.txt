overview:
Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a group of disorders in which the motor and/or sensory peripheral nerves are affected, resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy as well as sensory loss. Symptoms occur first in the distal legs and later in the hands. The nerve cells in individuals with this disorder are not able to send electrical signals properly because of abnormalities in the nerve axon or abnormalities in the insulation (myelin) around the axon. In CMT specific gene mutations are responsible for the abnormal function of the peripheral nerves. In many forms of CMT these genes are known and in others, while the condition is known to be inherited, the specific gene has not yet been identified.

symptoms:
Symptoms of CMT disease usually begin gradually in adolescence, but can begin earlier or later. In almost all patients, the longest nerve fibers are affected first. Over time, affected individuals may lose the normal use of their feet, hands, legs and arms. Common early signs and symptoms can include decreased sensitivity to heat, touch or pain, muscle weakness in the hand, foot or lower leg, trouble with fine motor skills, high-stepped gait (foot drop), loss of muscle mass in the lower leg, frequent tripping or falling, hammertoe, high foot arch and flat feet. Stretch reflexes may be lost. The disease is slowly progressive and variable, and those affected may remain active for years and live a normal life span. In the most severe cases, breathing difficulties can hasten death.
