overview:
Summary
Congenital tracheomalacia is a rare childhood form of tracheomalacia in which the cartilage around the windpipe (trachea) is weak at birth. As the infant breathes out, the trachea collapses making it difficult to breathe. Symptoms range from mild to severe shortness of breath (particularly during exercise and eating), loud breathing (stridor), bluish skin (cyanosis) and recurrent airway infections. Tracheomalacia is associated with many childhood syndromes (i.e. Ehlers Danlos syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia) and congenital diseases (i.e. tracheoesophageal fistula, double aortic arch) that weaken or compress the trachea. A weakened or compressed airway may occur by itself or alongside other airway abnormalities.
Children will have a harder time clearing mucus as the trachea collapses, which can lead to recurrent infections and difficulty breathing. If the trachea narrows >50% when exhaling, more symptoms will likely be present. These symptoms often resolve by themselves before the child turns 2 years old and can be managed by a team of clinicians. Treatment usually includes physical therapy, continuous positive pressure ventilation (CPAP) and monitoring for respiratory infections. More severe cases may need surgery to hold open the airway or relieve anything compressing it. Case severity may vary widely, but prognosis has continually improved with supportive measures.

symptoms:
Many patients with congenital tracheomalacia do not have symptoms. The most common symptoms include:
Shortness of breath (especially during exercise and eating)Recurrent respiratory infectionsStridor (a high-pitched sound made when breathing out)Bluish coloring around the lips and nose (cyanosis)Mucus buildup and productive “barking” coughRespiratory distress
