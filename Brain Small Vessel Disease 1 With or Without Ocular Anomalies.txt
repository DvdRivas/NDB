overview:
Brain small vessel disease 1 with or without ocular anomalies (BSVD1) is a rare genetic disorder in which fluid-filled cysts and cavities develop on the surface of the brain. Affected individuals are predisposed to damage to small blood vessels, including the small vessels within the brain. The signs and symptoms of this disorder vary greatly from one individual to another but may include weakness or paralysis of one side of the body (hemiparesis or hemiplegia), seizures, varying degrees of cognitive impairment and migraines. BSVD1 is caused by changes (disease-causing variants) in theCOL4A1gene and follows autosomal dominant inheritance.
Treatment is directed toward the specific symptoms that an affected person has.

symptoms:
The age of onset, specific symptoms, disease progression and severity of BSVD1 vary greatly from one person to another, even among members of the same family.
In some children, serious, life-threatening complications may occur in infancy; in others, only minor complications may occur and intelligence is unaffected. Other affected people may not develop any symptoms until well into adulthood. Affected individuals should talk to their physicians and medical team about their specific medical history and associated symptoms.
Symptoms that may occur in individuals with BDSV1 include:
Weakness of the facial muscles (facial paresis) resulting from damage to the facial nerveEye and vision problems such as:Visual field defectsBlurred vision due to an imperfection in the curvature of the cornea or lens of the eye (astigmatism)Crossed eyes (strabismus)Nearsightedness (myopia)Clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract)Increased pressure inside the eye (glaucoma)Axenfeld-Rieger anomalies (underdevelopment (hypoplasia) and eventual tearing of the colored part of the eye (iris) and a pupil that is not in the center of the eye)Arteries that twist and turn abnormally within the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (arterial retinal tortuosity) which may cause episodes of bleeding within the eye following any minor trauma to the eye, leading to temporary vision lossVascular problems such as weakening of the blood vessels in the brain which may result in:Stroke (often the first symptom), typically occurring in mid-adulthood and usually caused by bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke) rather than a lack of blood flow in the brain (ischemic stroke), although either type can occurNeurologic problems including:Leukoencephalopathy, which is a change in a type of brain tissue called white matter that can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)SeizuresMigraine headaches accompanied by visual sensations known as aurasParalysis of one side of the body (hemiparesis or hemiplegia)Varying degrees of intellectual disabilityDystonia, a group of neurological disorders characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positionsPoor or absent speech developmentInvoluntary muscle spasms (spasticity) that result in slow, stiff, rigid movementsHydrocephalus, a condition in which accumulation of excessive cerebrospinal fluid in the brain causes pressure on the tissues of the brain, resulting in a variety of symptomsDevelopment of fluid-filled cavities or cysts on the brain (porencephaly) that can delay and impair growth and developmentHemolytic anemia, a disorder in which red blood cells are destroyed (hemolysis) faster than they can be made
Some affected individuals may have additional symptoms sometimes associated with variants in theCOL4A1gene. For more information, see the COL4A1-related disorders in the Disorders with Similar Symptoms section below.
