Fox Fordyce Disease

synonyms:

overview:
Fox-Fordyce disease is a rare skin disorder that primarily affects women. The disorder is characterized by intense itching especially in the underarm area, the pubic area and around the nipples. In Fox-Fordyce disease abnormalities affecting the apocrine sweat glands causes inflammation, and enlargement of the glands and the characteristic intense itching. Skin near an affected area may become darkened and dry and multiple, small, raised bumps (papules) may develop. Hair follicles in the affected area can become secondarily damaged, resulting in hair loss. The exact cause of Fox-Fordyce disease is unknown.

symptoms:
The symptoms of Fox-Fordyce disease may appear suddenly usually following conditions of heat, humidity or friction. The disease is characterized by an eruption of multiple, small, raised bumps on the skin near the apocrine glands.
The apocrine glands are specialized sweat glands that play a pheromonic role in animals; a similar role has been postulated in humans. Pheromones are chemicals secreted by animals that influence social or sexual behavior of other animals of that species. Apocrine glands respond to sex and stress stimuli. Apocrine glands become extremely active during puberty. Most apocrine glands are found in the armpits or the groin. They may also be found by the nipples, external ear canal, eyelids, and around the bellybutton.
The papules are usually skin-colored, but may be yellowish or reddish in color. They are usually dome-shaped and smooth. Affected areas usually have many small papules. Papules are most often found in the armpits (axillae). The affected areas are often extremely itchy (pruritus) and sweating in these areas may also be absent (anhidrosis). Itching may be mild or may be severe enough to disturb sleep. Hairs within follicles in the affected area may fall out.
