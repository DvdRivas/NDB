Acromicric Dysplasia

synonyms:
Acromicric Skeletal Dysplasia

overview:
Acromicric Dysplasia is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormally short hands and feet, growth retardation and delayed bone maturation leading to short stature, and mild facial abnormalities. Most cases have occurred randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically). However, autosomal dominant inheritance has not been ruled out.

symptoms:
Acromicric Dysplasia is an extremely rare inherited disorder that usually becomes apparent during late infancy. It is characterized by abnormally short hands and feet, growth delays leading to short stature, and mild facial abnormalities.
Infants with Acromicric Dysplasia exhibit severe shortening of hands and feet. Certain bones in the hands and fingers (i.e., metacarpals and phalanges) as well as the feet and toes (i.e., metatarsals and phalanges) are abnormally short and stubby (brachydactyly). In addition, certain bones in the middle of the hand (metacarpals) may taper downward forming a point (with the exception of the thumb), while bones in the toes (phalanges) may be abnormally “cone shaped” (epiphyseal coning). The long bones (i.e., those of the arms and legs) may also be abnormally short and, in some cases, individuals may exhibit malformation of the end portion (head) of the thigh bone (femur).
By early childhood, growth retardation and delayed bone maturation eventually result in short stature (dwarfism). Most affected individuals described in the medical literature attained an average adult height of about four feet (120 centimeters).
Infants with Acromicric Dysplasia may also exhibit mild abnormalities of the face including an abnormally narrow opening between the upper and lower eyelids (palpebral fissures) and an abnormally short nose with upturned nostrils (anteverted).
As affected individuals age, facial abnormalities become less obvious. Some adults with Acromicric Dysplasia have developed carpal tunnel syndrome.
