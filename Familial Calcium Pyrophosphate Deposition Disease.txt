overview:
Summary
Chondrocalcinosis 1 and 2 (CCAL1 and CCAL2) are genetic forms of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), a metabolic disorder characterized by deposits of calcium pyrophosphate crystals (CPP) in joint cartilage and eventual damage to affected joints. The symptoms of CCAL1 and CCAL2 include swelling, stiffness, pain and loss of function of the affected joints. The knee is the most affected area. CCAL1 and CCAL2 are autosomal dominant genetic disorders that are usually diagnosed in early adulthood.

Introduction
The non-genetic forms of CPDD are much more common, and typically cause arthritis in patients over the age of 60.

symptoms:
The symptoms of CCAL1 and CCAL2 usually begin as acute, recurring attacks of pain, swelling, warmth and redness in one or more joints. Other affected people have swelling, stiffness, and pain with little or no inflammation in the joints.  A knee, wrist, hip, or shoulder is most frequently affected, although any joint of the body may be involved. Acute episodes can last for days to weeks, and symptoms may go away without treatment. CPP deposits may accumulate around the bones of the spine (vertebrae) and cause back or neck pain and/or loss of mobility. Many patients with CPPD develop chronic arthritis which can resemble osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.
