overview:
Essential iris atrophy is a very rare, progressive disorder of the eye characterized by a pupil that is out of place and/or distorted areas of degeneration on the iris (atrophy), and/or holes in the iris. This disorder most frequently affects only one eye (unilateral) and develops slowly over time. Attachment of portions of the iris to the cornea (peripheral anterior synechiae) and subsequent closure of the drainage angle may lead to secondary glaucoma and vision loss.
Essential iris atrophy is one of three iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndromes, each of which usually affects one eye of young to middle-aged men and women. The ICE syndromes (essential iris atrophy, Chandler syndrome, and Cogan-Reese syndrome) are distinct from one another. However, these disorders all affect the eyeand some of their symptoms overlap, making it difficult to distinguish between them. (For more information about Chandlerâ€™s syndrome, and Cogan-Reese syndrome, see the Related Disorders section of this report.)

symptoms:
Major symptoms of essential iris atrophy may include a displaced and/or distorted pupil, patchy areas of degeneration (atrophy) on the iris, and/or holes in the iris. The edge of the pupil may turn outward (ectropion uveae). The onset of this disorder is gradual, and the changes in the shape and placement of the pupil are usually noticed before any change in vision occurs. Degeneration and holes in the iris may develop over a period of several years.
Other features of essential iris atrophy may include the attachment of portions of the iris to the cornea (peripheral anterior synechiae), swelling of the cornea (corneal edema), and/or abnormalities in the cells lining the cornea (corneal endothelium). These changes may lead to increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma) and vision loss.
