Bullous Pemphigoid

synonyms:
pemphigoidBP

overview:
Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a rare, autoimmune, chronic skin disorder characterized by blistering, urticarial lesions (hives) and itching. Less commonly these blisters can involve the mucous membranes including the eyes, oral mucosa, esophagus and genital mucosa.  It typically presents in older adults as a generalized intensely itchy blistering skin condition.

symptoms:
The first symptom of BP is usually redness and itching of the skin. Within weeks to months, thin-walled, tense blisters with clear fluid centers (bullae) appear on the arms and legs (flexor surfaces), in the armpits (axillae), on the abdomen, and/or in the skinfolds of the groin. Mucous membranes may also be involved but are less commonly seen than skin blisters.
The blisters are usually tense (tight), and contain clear or blood-tinged fluid; they do not rupture easily with gentle contact. If the blisters do rupture, pain may occur but healing is usually rapid and resolves without scarring.
Bullous pemphigoid usually itches and in its early phase urticarial (hives) lesions may be present before blisters are noted.
