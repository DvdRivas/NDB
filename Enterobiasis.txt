overview:
Enterobiasis or pinworm infection is a common, contagious, parasitic infestation found mainly in children. The disorder is spread by swallowing or inhaling the tiny eggs of the pinworm. Enterobiasis rarely causes any serious physical problems except for the main symptom, which is severe rectal itching.

symptoms:
The major symptom of enterobiasis is itching in the anal area.  There may also be restlessness and difficulty sleeping.  Secondary bacterial infections may develop in the areas that are constantly scratched and, very infrequently, the vagina may become involved in young girls.  Very rarely, enterobiasis may lead to appendicitis or inflammation of the fallopian tubes in females.
Many children with enterobiasis show no symptoms (asymptomatic). In rare cases, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, involuntary discharge of urine at night (enuresis) or stomach pain may occur.  The disorder is usually first identified when live, thin, white pinworms, (females are about 10 mm in length and males are 4-5 mm in length) are noticed in the feces.
