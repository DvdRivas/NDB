overview:
Choroideremia is a genetic disorder of sight that usually affects males. Female carriers may have mild symptoms without loss of vision. Major symptoms are difficulty seeing in the dark leading to progressive loss of peripheral vision, followed by tunnel vision. The rate and degree of vision loss differs among individuals. Night blindness, usually the first noticeable symptom, generally occurs during childhood.

symptoms:
Choroideremia is characterized by extensive loss of all retinal layers in the eyes. This disorder usually begins during childhood with wasting (atrophy) of the pigmented retinal epithelium, retina, and choroid. The retina is the light sensitive, most internal layer, consisting of many nerve containing layers. A layer of single pigmented cells is the layer outside of the retina. The choroid is the next layer located between the retina and the “white” section of the eye (the sclera); this layer contains small blood vessel).
Degeneration of the blood vessels of the choroid is followed by damage to the retina, which usually leads to loss of peripheral vision that can progress to eventual blindness. Central vision is usually preserved until late in life. The symptoms of choroideremia may vary greatly between affected individuals. Female carriers usually have very mild symptoms with night blindness or sensitivity to glare occurring late in life.
