overview:
Summary
5,10 – methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase deficiency is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, difficulty growing and gaining weight (failure to thrive), lack of myelin production in the brain (cerebral hypomyelination), short stature, seizures (epilepsy), small head (microcephaly), spasticity and rigidity. Symptoms may be present at birth, but not recognized until later in infancy or childhood when developmental delays and growth problems become more obvious. This disorder is caused by changes (disease-causing variants) in theMTHFSgene.This gene is involved in processing folate which is known to be a vital part of brain development.
Introduction
Early diagnosis ofMTHFSdeficiency is important in order to make dietary changes to reduce folate/folic acid and start treatment with oral L-meth folate supplements and intramuscular methyl cobalamin. This may help to improve symptoms and development.

symptoms:
The first signs ofMTHFSdeficiency are developmental delay, global failure to thrive and microcephaly. Affected children start to show signs of rigidity and spasticity as they develop. Seizures may not be noticeable right away but affected children will eventually be diagnosed with different types of epilepsy. An MRI will show cerebral hypomyelination. Some patients have more severe disabilities than others.
