Summary
Achondroplasia is the most commonly occurring abnormality of bone growth (skeletal dysplasia), occurring in approximately 1 in 20,000-30,000 live births. This genetic disorder is characterized by an unusually large head (macrocephaly), short upper arms (rhizomelic dwarfism), elbow flexion contractures, trident hands, leg bowing and short stature (adult height of approximately 4 feet). Achondroplasia does not typically cause impairment or deficiencies in mental abilities. If the bones that join the head and neck do not compress the brainstem or upper spinal cord (craniocervical junction compression), life expectancy is near normal.
Achondroplasia is caused by a change (pathogenic variant) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene which is a regulator of bone growth at cartilage growth plates. Clinical features result from decreased growth of bones that grow through cartilage. Achondroplasia occurs because of a spontaneous change in theFGFR3gene in approximately 80 percent of patients; in the remaining 20 percent it is inherited from a parent.

symptoms:
GeneralThis rare genetic disorder is characterized by distinctive features: short stature (usually under 4 feet 6 inches); an unusually large head (macrocephaly) with a prominent forehead (frontal bossing) and flat (depressed) nasal bridge; short arms and legs; prominent abdomen and buttocks (due to inward curve of the spine) and short hands with fingers that assume a “trident” or three-pronged position during extension.
InfancyNewborns have a relatively large cranium with a broad forehead, midface hypoplasia (flatter midface), mildly narrower chest and short extremities. About 5% of infants may develop an excessive accumulation of fluid around the brain under pressure (hydrocephalus). Due to hypotonia and joint laxity, motor milestones are usually delayed. Expressive speech may also be delayed.
