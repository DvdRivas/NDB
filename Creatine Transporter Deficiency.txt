overview:
Summary

Creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) is an inborn error of creatine metabolism. The onset of symptoms occurs during infancy, but the average age of diagnosis ranges from 2 to 66 years of age. Since the disease is now becoming better recognized and testing is available, it is anticipated that diagnosis will primarily occur within the first 3 years of life..

Introduction

CTD is one of the three cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS). These conditions are inborn errors of creatine metabolism which interrupt the formation or transport of creatine. Creatine is necessary to favor the utilization of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy to all cells in the body. Creatine is essential to sustain the high energy levels needed for muscle and brain development.

symptoms:
The severity of CTD varies from patient to patient. Global developmental delays affect all children with this disorder and may be the first sign, appearing before other symptoms. Intellectual disability of variable severity is typically present with prominent speech and language delay, autistic behavior and seizures.Additional symptoms may include, muscle weakness, behavior disorders, hyperactivity and gastrointestinal problems. Children with CTD may experience slow growth (failure to thrive) and delayed development of motor skills such as sitting and walking. Affected individuals tend to tire easily.
