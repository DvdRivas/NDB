Esophageal Cancer

overview:
Summary
Esophageal cancer is a rare type of cancer that starts in the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. In this disease, cells in the esophagus grow uncontrollably, forming a tumor that can make swallowing difficult. Esophageal cancer can spread to other parts of the body, including the liver, lungs, bones and brain.
There are several types of esophageal cancer based on the kind of cells involved. The most common types are:
Squamous cell carcinoma: This type starts in the flat cells that line the esophagus. It’s more common in East Asia and the Middle East.Adenocarcinoma: This type begins in cells that produce mucus and is more common in the lower part of the esophagus, especially in Western countries.
In the early stages, esophageal cancer might not cause any symptoms. As it progresses, symptoms may include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), pain when swallowing (odynophagia), unintended weight loss, heartburn or indigestion that doesn’t improve with treatment and chest pain.  Other symptoms may include anemia, vomiting or coughing blood, hoarseness, persistent hiccups or back pain and, in rare cases, an abnormal passage (fistula) between the esophagus and the windpipe that may result in breathing problems.
The cause of esophageal cancer isn’t fully understood, but it likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
Treatment depends on the stage of the disease and includes surgery to remove the tumor, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapies and supportive measures.

symptoms:
In the early stages, esophageal cancer often doesn’t cause any noticeable symptoms (asymptomatic). However, as the tumor grows, it may start to block the esophagus, leading to difficulty swallowing, especially solid foods—a condition known as dysphagia.
Affected people may feel that certain foods like meat, apples, or bread feel like they are “sticking” in their throat. As the tumor enlarges, even swallowing liquids can become difficult.
As the cancer progresses, additional symptoms may develop:
Pain when swallowing (odynophagia) which is often felt with dry foods and can help distinguish esophageal cancer from less serious causes of swallowing difficultyUnintended weight loss, one of the most common symptoms associated with esophageal cancerIndigestion and heartburn that does not improve with medicationChest pain, often worsening after eating
Anemia and blood loss can lead to iron deficiency anemia, a condition where the body has too few red blood cells to carry oxygen effectively. Symptoms of anemia include:Fatigue and weaknessPale skinLightheadednessDark and sticky stools, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding that has gone unnoticed
Some symptoms are less common but may still occur as the cancer advances:
Swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the neck (cervical lymphadenopathy)Vomiting blood (hematemesis)Coughing up blood (hemoptysis)Hoarseness caused by the tumor compressing the vocal cordsHiccups or spinal pain which can occur if the tumor presses on nearby nerves
In rare cases, esophageal cancer can cause a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), which is an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the windpipe. This can allow food and liquids to enter the lungs, leading to severe breathing problems and pneumonia.
Esophageal cancer can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, with the liver, lungs, bones and brain being the most common sites. Symptoms vary depending on where the cancer has spread:
FeverEnlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly)Chronic cough, shortness of breath, or fluid buildup around the lungs (pleural effusion)Bone painHeadaches, confusion, or seizures
