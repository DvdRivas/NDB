overview:
Anemia of chronic disease, also called the anemia of inflammation, is a condition that can be associated with many different underlying disorders including chronic illnesses such as cancer, certain infections and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Anemia is defined by low levels of circulating red blood cells or hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen. Anemia of chronic disease is usually a mild or moderate condition. In mild cases, anemia may not be associated with any symptoms or may cause fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor) and lightheadedness. The underlying mechanisms that cause anemia of chronic disease are complex and not fully understood.

symptoms:
Anemia of chronic disease varies in severity from one person to another. In most people, anemia is usually mild or moderate. Affected individuals may develop a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor), lightheadedness, shortness of breath, a fast heartbeat, irritability, chest pain and additional findings. These symptoms may occur in any individual who has a comparable degree of anemia. In most cases, the symptoms associated with the underlying disease usually take precedent over the mild or moderate anemia symptoms. In rare cases, anemia of chronic disease can be severe and cause more serious complications.
