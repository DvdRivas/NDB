overview:
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare digestive disease characterized by the triad of eosinophilic infiltration of segments of the gastrointestinal tract, abnormalities of gastrointestinal function (varying from dyspepsia and obstruction to diarrhea and ascites) and exclusion of other diseases with peripheral eosinophilia. Eosinophilic esophagitis is increasingly being recognized and is not included in this report.

symptoms:
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum. Symptoms include dysphagia (sometimes presenting as food impaction), heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloating (ascites is possible). The eosinophilic infiltration may involve one or more layers of the gastrointestinal wall. The particular symptoms present in each person depend upon the layer and the location of involvement. Most commonly, the stomach wall and the small bowel are involved. Mucosal involvement leads to protein-losing enteropathy and malabsorption. Muscle layer involvement causes abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspeptic symptoms and bowel obstruction. Subserosal involvement predominantly causes ascites with marked eosinophilia. Sometimes eosinophilic pleural effusion is present. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a chronic, waxing and waning condition.
