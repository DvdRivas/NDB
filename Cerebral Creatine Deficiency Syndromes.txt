Cerebral Creatine Deficiency Syndromes

synonyms:
CCDS

overview:
Cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS) are inborn errors of creatine metabolism which interrupt the formation or transport of creatine. Creatine is necessary to render available the energy of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to all cells in the body. Creatine is essential to sustain the high energy levels needed for muscle and brain development.
There are three types of CCDS: creatine transporter deficiency (CTD), guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT) and arginine: glycine amidinotransferase deficiency (AGAT).

symptoms:
The severity of CCDS varies from patient to patient. Global developmental delays affect all children with these disorders and may be the first sign, appearing before other symptoms. Speech delay may be particularly severe and is present in all affected children. Intellectual disability of variable severity is typically present in all older children and adults.
Additional symptoms may include seizure disorders, muscle weakness, behavior disorders, autism-like behaviors, movement disorders, gastrointestinal problems, and failure to thrive.
