overview:
Bejel is an infectious disease that is rare in the United States but common in certain parts of the world. The infection is very similar to syphilis but is not sexually transmitted. Most frequently, transmission is by means of non-sexual skin contact or by common use of eating and drinking utensils. The organism that causes bejel belongs to the same family as the bacterium that causes syphilis, pinta and yaws and is known as treponema. Treponemas are spiral-shaped bacteria (spirochetes). Also known as endemic syphilis, bejel is characterized by lesions of the skin and bones that begin in the mouth and progress in gradual stages. The late stages are the most severe.
Bejel is very common in dry, hot climates especially in the countries of the eastern Mediterranean region and in Saharan West Africa.

symptoms:
At the outset, children with bejel have patchy, slimy, ulcerations (lesions) on the mucous membranes, particularly in or near the mouth.  Later, blisters appear on the back, arms, and legs.  Further disease progression is indicated by infections of the bones, especially those of the legs.  In these later stages, soft, gummy lumps (gummas) appear on the roof of the mouth and in the nasal passages.
Other symptoms may include swollen glands or lymph nodes (lymph-adenopathy), and/or skin ulcerations under the arms or around the rectum and groin.
