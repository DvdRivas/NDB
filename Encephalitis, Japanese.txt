Symptoms include high fever, headaches, weakness, nausea, vomiting, paralysis, personality changes, and coma, possibly leading to neurological damage or death.

symptoms:
Japanese Encephalitis is a rare viral disorder characterized by high fever, headaches, weakness, nausea, vomiting, mental deterioration, personality changes, psychoses, impaired speech, spastic rigidity, and paralysis of the face or extremities.
In adults, paralysis may occur on both sides of the body without altered sensation. The duration of symptoms can vary widely and convalescence may be prolonged. Some affected individuals may experience swelling and small areas of bleeding within the brain. Wasting away (atrophy) of brain and nerve cells may also occur. The immune system is also weakened by the virus, potentially making affected individuals vulnerable to more serious infections.
