overview:
EEF1A2-related neurodevelopmental disorder is a very rare disorder caused by harmful variants in theEEF1A2gene that have arisen spontaneously. There are many different types of these variants, and the effects are very variable, sometimes even in children with the same variant. Most children, but not all, will have epilepsy, developmental delay and intellectual disability. Some also have challenging behaviours and/or movement disorders.

symptoms:
EEF1A2-related neurodevelopmental disorder has a variable presentation but almost always involves epileptic seizures, developmental delay and intellectual disability. Most children, but not all, will have onset of epileptic seizures of different types within the first four months of life. The most common seizure type are myoclonic seizures, with most children developing other seizure types. The seizures can be difficult to control, but in some children, the seizures respond well to treatment. Significant global developmental delay will be seen in most but not all. Early concerns about low muscle tone, even within the first month of life, are often reported. There are no consistent characteristic features on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging studies. There have been reports that some children have a broad nasal bridge, tented upper lip, everted lower lip and downturned corners of the mouth but this is not seen in all affected children.
