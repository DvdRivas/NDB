overview:
Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) is one of several forms of a rare type of muscular dystrophy known as congenital muscular dystrophy. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Symptoms of this disorder are apparent at birth and progress slowly. In addition to general muscle weakness and deformities of the joints (contractures), FCMD is often accompanied by seizures, intellectual disability and speech problems. This disorder is predominantly found in Japan.

symptoms:
Infants with FCMD are “floppy” at birth and usually have problems sucking and swallowing. They have a weak cry and there is a loss of muscle tone as well as weakness of the muscles. The joints in the knees and elbows may be in a fixed position (contractures) and reflexes of the tendons are poor.
Intellectual disability is characteristic of this form of muscular dystrophy. Also, some affected infants and children have seizures. A sunken chest and a severe form of grand mal seizures called status epilepticus has been found in a few individuals with FCMD.
