overview:
Summary

Arginine: glycine amidinotransferase deficiency (AGAT) is one of the three cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS). These conditions are inborn errors of creatine metabolism which interrupt the formation or transport of creatine. Creatine is necessary to use properly adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy to all cells in the body.

symptoms:
The severity of AGAT varies from patient to patient. People with AGAT typically present with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, delayed speech and may have seizure activity. Some individuals may develop autistic like behaviors. Children with AGAT may not gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting and walking. Affected individuals may also have weak muscle tone and tend to tire easily.
