overview:
Summary
Deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) disorder, also known as “neurodevelopmental disorder with seizures and speech and walking impairment” is a very rare disorder. It is characterized by global developmental delay, especially speech delay, as well as walking difficulties due to low or highl muscle tone (hypotonia, hypertonia), spasticity or poor coordination. Other features include seizures, mild facial differences and variable short stature.
DHPS is caused by changes (pathogenic variants or mutations) in theDHPSgene and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.

symptoms:
The signs and symptoms are varied, usually begin in childhood and may include:
•	Neurodevelopmental / cognitive delays•	Speech and language delays (poor or absent speech)•	Delayed walking, mild•	Unsteady gait•	Balance problems•	Coordination problems•	Spasticity•	Seizures/epilepsy•	Anomalies in the electroencephalogram (test for electrical activity in the brain)•	Short stature•	Failure to thrive (difficulty growing and gaining weight)
•	Facial differences that are mild, variable and may include:o	     Low-set earso	     Deep-set eyeso	     Prominent skinfolds or creases beneath the lower eyelido	     Different distribution of eyebrow hair growth in the internal regiono	     Prominent nasal bridgeo	     High-arched palate
•	Constipation•	Abnormal curving of the fifth finger•	Congenital hip dislocation•	Sacral dimple•	Muscle tone anomalies such as low muscle tone affecting the trunk of the body (axial hypotonia) and high muscle tone affecting the legs and/or arms (limb hypertonia)•	High pain threshold•	Normal brain imaging•	Behavioral problems such as hand-flapping and pica (desire to eat substances such as chalk or ashes)•	Immunological problems such as low IgA (1 family) and low IgG (1 family)•	Problems during the mother’s pregnancy such as high blood pressure (hypertension) or low blood pressure (hypotension)•	Birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy (premature)
