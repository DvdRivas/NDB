Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome

overview:
Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), also known as familial cold urticaria, is a rare, inherited inflammatory disorder characterized by intermittent episodes of rash, fever, joint pain and other signs/symptoms of systemic inflammation triggered by exposure to cold. Onset of FCAS occurs during infancy and early childhood and persists throughout the patient’s life.
FCAS is one of the cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) caused by mutations in the CIAS1/NLRP3 gene. These syndromes are characterized by fever, rash, and joint pain. As in other CAPS, amyloidosis can rarely develop later in life in FCAS patients. Amyloidosis is due to an abnormal accumulation of the protein amyloid in a patient’s tissues and organs such as the kidneys where it results in damage and often kidney failure if untreated.
FCAS shares symptoms, and should not be confused, with acquired cold urticaria, a more common condition mediated by different mechanisms that usually develops later in life and is rarely inherited.

symptoms:
Patients with FCAS experience mild to debilitating symptoms such as rash, fatigue, recurrent fever and chills, recurrent joint pain, and recurrent conjunctivitis (inflammation of the outer most layer of the eye causing redness, discomfort and discharge from the eye).
Other symptoms include profuse sweating, drowsiness, headache, extreme thirst, red eyes, blurred vision, eye pain, watering eyes and nausea
Symptoms occur within hours after exposure to cold. In most cases, a rash will occur within the first 1-2 hours, followed by a fever and joint pain. Episodes usually last for less than 24 hours.
