Achard Thiers Syndrome

synonyms:
Diabetic Bearded Woman Syndrome

overview:
Achard-Thiers syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs primarily in postmenopausal women and is characterized by type 2 (insulin-resistant) diabetes mellitus and signs of androgen excess. The exact cause of this syndrome is unknown.

symptoms:
The original description and usual emphasis in this syndrome is on the affected individual as a bearded woman with diabetes mellitus.  In older women, the first clinical symptoms are often those associated with classic diabetes and may include abnormally high blood glucose due to the body’s inability to utilize insulin properly.
Those affected may also have abnormally high levels of glucose in the urine, frequent urination, excessive thirst and hunger, and weight loss.  Other signs of the syndrome are directly due to the overproduction of androgens, and may include an increase in body hair, particularly on the face, chest, back, and other areas, receding hairline, deepening of the voice, enlargement of the clitoris; infertility; and obesity.
Typically, a detailed patient history shows the development of infrequent or very light menstrual periods in someone who has previously had normal menstruation (oligomenorrhea) or the absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) soon after the first menstrual period (menarche), commonly followed by development of excess body hair (hirsutism) and rapid weight gain.  Many women with the disorder have acanthosis nigricans.
The constellation of clinical androgen excess and failure of the blood sugar control system to work properly (hyperinsulinemia) is now commonly identified earlier in a woman’s life, typically during adolescence and young adulthood, as polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS.
