FG Syndrome Type 1

synonyms:
FGS1Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome

overview:
FG syndrome type 1 (FGS1) is an X-linked genetic disorder that is characterized by poor muscle tone (hypotonia), intellectual disability, constipation and or anal anomalies and complete or partial absence of the part of the brain that connects the two hemispheres of the brain (corpus callosum). Other features of the disorder are small and simple ears, tall and prominent forehead, wide and flat thumbs and great toes and down slanting eyes. FGS1 is an X-linked genetic disorder typically caused by a change (variant or mutation) in theMED12gene. The spectrum of disorders caused by variants in this gene is still being defined. Some individuals previously diagnosed with FGS1 do not have aMED12gene variant and, therefore, probably have a different reason for intellectual disability.
