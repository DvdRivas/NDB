Dilatation of the Pulmonary Artery, Idiopathic

synonyms:
IDPA

overview:
Idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary artery (IDPA) is a rare congenital defect characterized by a wider than normal main pulmonary artery in the absence of any apparent anatomical or physiological cause.

symptoms:
Idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary artery commonly does not produce symptoms because there is no circulatory abnormality.  Clinical signs are minimal, and usually consist of a palpable pulmonary ejection sound that disappears when the patient inhales, a soft pulmonary ejection systolic murmur (abnormal heart sound), and splitting of the second sound on breathing in.  IDPA does not cause pulmonary valve disease, nor does bacterial endocarditis occur in patients with this condition.  The electrocardiogram is normal, and diagnosis is made when chest X-rays reveal a dilated pulmonary artery without cardiac chamber enlargement.
