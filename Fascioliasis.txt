Fascioliasis

synonyms:
FasciolosisLiver fluke disease

overview:
Fascioliasis is a rare infectious disorder caused by parasites. These parasites are liver flukes that live in plant-eating animals. Liver flukes can be found on water plants in certain parts of the world. When the parasite invades the liver, bile passages may be blocked. A subdivision of Fascioliasis called Halzoun Syndrome affects the throat (pharynx). This infection can usually be controlled and/or cured with timely treatment.

symptoms:
The disease has three phases: acute, latent, and chronic.  The acute phase begins approximately four days after infection and can last for two to four months.  Symptoms during this phase include fever, abdominal pain with tender liver, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hives (urticaria) accompanied by bouts of bronchial asthma.  The latent phase begins when mature flukes reach the bile duct and can last for several months.  Individuals in this phase are asymptomatic.  The chronic phase can persist for several years.  Symptoms include gastrointestinal pain, fatty food intolerance, nausea, jaundice, itching, and abdominal tenderness.
