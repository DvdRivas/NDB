overview:
Summary
Desmoid tumor commonly develops in the fibrous (connective) tissues of the body that connect, support and surround other body parts and organs. Desmoid tumors grow from a fibroblast cell known as myofibroblast,  which make up connective tissue and are also important for wound healing. They can develop anywhere in the body. Superficial desmoids tend to be less aggressive than deep desmoids (abdominal, extra abdominal, mesenteric). Desmoid tumors look like dense scar tissue. They adhere to surrounding structures and organs and are often difficult to remove. Surgery has been the traditional therapy for desmoid tumors but up to 20-30% will recur after surgery.
Introduction
Desmoid tumor is called aggressive fibromatosis as it has similarities with a malignant (cancerous) tumor called fibrosarcoma. Desmoid tumors do not spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.
