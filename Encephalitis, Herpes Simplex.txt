overview:
Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). Common symptoms include headaches, fevers, drowsiness, hyperactivity, and/or general weakness. The disorder may have some symptoms similar to those associated with meningitis, such as a stiff neck, altered reflexes, confusion, and/or speech abnormalities. Skin lesions usually are not found in association with herpes simplex encephalitis. Herpes simplex encephalitis is caused by a virus known as herpes simplex virus (HSV).

symptoms:
Symptoms associated with herpes simplex encephalitis usually develop over several days, often without warning. Early symptoms include headaches, fevers, and seizures. Additional symptoms include drowsiness with general weakness (stupor), and confusion or disorientation.
After the initial symptoms appear, affected individuals may develop speech abnormalities such as a diminished ability to communicate by speech, writing, and/or signs (aphasia), absence of the sense of smell (anosmia), and memory loss. In some cases, behavioral changes such as hyperactivity or psychotic episodes occur.  Some symptoms of herpes simplex encephalitis may mimic meningitis. These symptoms may include a stiff neck, altered reflexes, confusion, convulsions, and paralysis.
Individuals with herpes simplex encephalitis may develop more severe symptoms, including loss of consciousness, hallucinations, and partial paralysis (hemiparesis). In some rare cases, herpes simplex encephalitis may affect the nerve-rich membrane lining the eyes (retina), resulting in inflammation of the retina (retinitis).
