overview:
Epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI) is a genetic skin disorder that is characterized by varying degrees of blistering and scaling of the skin. The symptoms of the disease are often noticed at birth or shortly after, and symptoms change as the patient ages. Symptoms may vary from mild blistering upon friction to severe erosions or widespread warty scaling. Hair and nail abnormalities, reduced sweating and the formation of calluses on the palms or soles (palmoplantar keratoderma) of the feet can also occur. Under a microscope, the skin may show mid-epidermal splitting and skin thickening (hyperkeratosis). Current treatments address the specific symptoms and can include topical treatments, medications and antiseptic washes for skin infections. The cosmetic issues and sometimes unpleasant odor associated with EI can lead to stress and psychological distress.

symptoms:
The symptoms of EI progress with the patientâ€™s age. Infants more commonly show signs of red, blistering skin and will usually develop thickened skin (cornification) and scaling into adulthood. Infants may also show growths on the inner surface of the eyelid (conjunctival hamartoma). Scales tend to form in parallel rows of spines or ridges. Reddened skin (erythroderma), itchiness (pruritus) and abnormal dryness (xerosis) are common symptoms. Skin ulcers and other damage can lead to bacterial infections. Heat intolerance and sensitivity to sunlight may also occur. A palmoplantar keratoderma may be present and can be so severe as to limit movement and hand function. Milder cases usually show minimal blistering in areas subject to friction or have only a palmoplantar keratoderma.
