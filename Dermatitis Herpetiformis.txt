overview:
Summary
Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune skin condition characterized by the presence of groups of severely itchy blisters and raised red skin lesions. These are most commonly located on the elbows, knees, buttocks, lower back and scalp. The most common age of onset of DH is 30-40 years of age but individuals of all ages can be affected. DH is rare in children.
DH is a skin manifestation of celiac disease (CD). DH is treated with a gluten free diet and frequently a medication called dapsone.

symptoms:
This autoimmune disease may cause skin, oral and/or gastrointestinal manifestations related to gluten-sensitivity.
Skin ManifestationsThe classic finding of DH is the development of intensely itchy blisters, and red raised skin lesions that occur in groups. Itching and burning may be almost intolerable and the need to scratch may become irresistible. The most common sites for lesion development are the elbows, knees, buttocks, and scalp. The face and groin are less frequently involved.
Oral ManifestationsTooth enamel defects found in CD such as horizontal grooves, pits, or discoloration may occur in patients with DH. Patients with DH can rarely develop oral ulcerations (canker sores).
Gastrointestinal ManifestationsDH is a skin manifestation of CD and virtually every patient has gluten sensitivity causing inflammation and damage to the small intestine. DH patients generally have less gastrointestinal symptoms than patients with CD.  Symptomatic patients may present with abdominal bloating, cramping, pain, diarrhea, or constipation.
