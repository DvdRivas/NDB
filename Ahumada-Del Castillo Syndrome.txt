overview:
Ahumada-Del Castillo is a rare endocrine disorder affecting adult females, which is characterized by impairment in the function of the pituitary and hypothalamus glands. Symptoms may include the production of breast milk (lactation) not associated with nursing and the absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) due to the lack of monthly ovulation (anovulation).

symptoms:
The symptoms of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome include the abnormal production of breast milk (galactorrhea) without childbirth and nursing, and the lack of regular menstrual periods (amenorrhea).  Women with this disorder have breasts and nipples of normal size and appearance.  Secondary female sexual characteristics, such as hair distribution and voice, are also normal.  Since the ovaries do not produce eggs, affected females cannot become pregnant.
