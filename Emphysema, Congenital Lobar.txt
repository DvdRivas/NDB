overview:
Congenital lobar emphysema is a rare respiratory disorder in which air can enter the lungs but cannot escape, causing overinflation (hyperinflation) of the lobes of the lung. It is most often detected in newborns or young infants, but some cases do not become apparent until adulthood. This disorder may be severe enough to cause associated heart problems (15% of cases) or so mild as to never become apparent. Some cases of congenital lobar emphysema may be caused by autosomal dominant inheritance while others occur for no apparent reason (sporadic).

symptoms:
Congenital lobar emphysema is characterized by  (1) difficulty in breathing or very rapid respiration (respiratory distress) in infancy, (2) an enlarged chest due to overinflation of at least one lobe of the lung, (3) compressed normal lung tissue in the section of the lung nearest to the diseased lobe, (4) bluish color of the skin due to a lack of oxygen in the blood (cyanosis), and (5) underdevelopment of the cartilage that supports the bronchial tube (bronchial hypoplasia).
Congenital lobar emphysema most often affects the upper lobe of the left lung and, less frequently, the middle right lobe.  It may cause the lung tissue to be very fragile and to collapse easily.
Experience suggests that the earlier the age of onset of congenital lobar emphysema, the more likely it is that the symptoms will get worse and lung function will degenerate as well.
