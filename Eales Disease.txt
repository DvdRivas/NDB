Eales Disease

synonyms:
Eales RetinopathyIdiopathic Peripheral Periphlebitis

overview:
Eales Disease is a rare disorder of sight that appears as an inflammation and white haze around the outercoat of the veins in the retina. The disorder is most prevalent among young males and normally affects both eyes. Usually, vision is suddenly blurred because the clear jelly that fills the eyeball behind the lens of the eye seeps out (vitreous hemorrhaging).

symptoms:
Eales Disease usually presents as blurred vision resulting from oozing of the clear jelly-like substance from behind the lens of the eye.  At the onset of the disorder, the small outer veins of the retina show sheathing (encapsulation or covering).  As the disease progresses, the inflammation around the veins in the retina extends further behind the lens.  Eales Disease may also be associated with peripheral retinal neovascularization which is the formation of new blood vessels on the outer part of the retina.
The more advanced cases of Eales Disease are characterized by a non- inflammatory degenerative disease of the retina (retinopathy) and extensive bleeding in the retina.  The colorless jelly that fills the eyeball behind the lens oozes from the retina (vitreous hemorrhage) and, in rare cases, the retina may become detached.  A reddish discoloration of the iris may be present (rubeosis iridis), and there may be loss of vision and damage to the optic disk (neovascular glaucoma).  Clouding of the lens of the eye that obstructs the passage of light (cataracts) may develop as the disease progresses.
