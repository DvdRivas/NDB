Catamenial Pneumothorax

overview:
Catamenial pneumothorax is an extremely rare condition that affects women. Pneumothorax is the medical term for a collapsed lung, a condition in which air or gas is trapped in the space surrounding the lungs causing the lungs to collapse. Women with catamenial pneumothorax have recurrent episodes of pneumothorax that occur within 72 hours before or after the start of menstruation. The exact cause of catamenial pneumothorax is unknown and several theories have been proposed. Some cases are associated with the abnormal development of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus (endometriosis), although the exact nature of this relationship in these cases is unknown.

symptoms:
The symptoms and severity of catamenial pneumothorax can vary from one episode to another and from one person to another. In the majority of affected women, the right lung is affected.
Symptoms that may occur with catamenial pneumothorax include monthly episodes of chest pain that can radiate to the shoulder blades, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (dyspnea), dizziness, fatigue, and a dry cough. Some women have reported a “crackling” sound upon inhaling during an episode.
Chest pain associated with a collapsed lung is often severe and the condition often requires prompt medical attention.
