Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome

BPESblepharophimosis syndrome

overview:
Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare developmental condition affecting the eyelids and ovary. Typically, four major facial features are present at birth: narrow eyes, droopy eyelids, an upward fold of skin of the inner lower eyelids and widely set eyes. These features cause difficulty in opening the eyes fully and may affect an affected individual’s quality of vision. BPES type I involves premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in females as well as the characteristic facial features, whereas BPES type II is characterized by these facial features alone. Potential treatments include corrective eyelid surgery, hormone replacement therapy for premature ovarian insufficiency and embryo/egg donation for consequent problems with fertility.

symptoms:
The four major features that are characteristic symptoms of BPES are present at birth: narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), formation of an upward fold of the inner lower eyelid (epicanthus inversus) and increased distance between the eyes (telecanthus). There are two types of BPES, BPES type I and type II, which are both characterized by the typical eyelid malformation. However, BPES type I is also associated with loss of ovarian function or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Menstrual periods in women with POI become less frequent over time and stop before the age of 40 thus leading to either difficulty (subfertility) or inability to conceive (infertility).  Other minor facial features frequently observed in both types include “lazy” eye (amblyopia), crossed eyes (strabismus), low-set ears, a short distance between the upper lip and nose, and a broad nasal bridge.
