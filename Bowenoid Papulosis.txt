overview:
Bowenoid Papulosis is a rare, sexually transmitted disorder thought to be caused by human papillomavirus type 16.

symptoms:
Bowenoid Papulosis is a rare sexually transmitted infection that is characterized by lesions that are typically found on the genitals.  These lesions may last from two weeks to several years.  Females may be affected inside the vagina, on the clitoris, groin folds, labia major, labia minor and/or anus.  Males may be affected on the glans, shaft and/or foreskin of the penis as well as the anus.  The lesions found in Bowenoid Papulosis are usually reddish brown or violet in color, small, solid, smooth, raised and velvety.  The lesions on females are usually darker than the lesions on males.
Many patients with Bowenoid Papulosis often have other types of viral infections that precede this condition.  Herpes simplex, human papallomavirus, viral warts, and HIV infection have been found in some patients with this disorder.  When viewed under a microscope the Bowenoid Papulosis tissue structure looks like pre-invasive squamous-cell carcinoma (a form of cancer cells).  In some cases Bowenoid Papulosis has become malignant.
